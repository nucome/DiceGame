Description
There is a game that is played with 5 dice. The objective of the game is to
obtain the lowest possible score. To that end, the rules of the game are as
follows: - All dice are thrown on a board.
- If there are any 3’s, all the 3’s are taken off the board and a score of 0 is awarded for this roll.
- If there are not any 3’s, the lowest die is taken off the board and the value of that lowest die is awarded for this roll.
- The remaining dice are now re-thrown and the same procedure as above is
followed until there are no dice left on the board.
- The total score for the game is the sum of all the rolls.
