● Update Todos
  ⎿  [×] Create Java class for 5-dice game simulation
     [×] Implement game logic for dice rolling and scoring rules
     [×] Run 10000 game simulations and track score frequencies
     [×] Generate formatted output showing score distribution

● Created DiceGame.java that implements the 5-dice game with the specified rules:

  - Uses Java 17 features
  - Simulates 10,000 games and tracks score frequencies
  - Follows the game rules: removes all 3s (score 0) or removes lowest die (adds to score)
  - Outputs results in the requested format with percentages and counts
  - Measures execution time

  Run with: java DiceGame.java

> java DiceGame.java

● Bash(java DiceGame.java)
  ⎿  Number of simulations was 10000 using 5 dice.
     Total 0 occurs 0.02 occurred 208.0 times.
     Total 1 occurs 0.04 occurred 417.0 times.
     … +21 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The program ran successfully and shows the simulation results for 10,000 games using 5 dice. The output displays score
  frequencies from 0 to 21, with lower scores being more common due to the game mechanics of removing 3s for 0 points and
  removing the lowest die value otherwise.


promt 2:  improve the code to change the number of Dice used and the number of simulations easily for simulation

● The code has been improved to make the number of dice and simulations configurable:

  Usage examples:
  - Default: java DiceGame.java (5 dice, 10000 simulations)
  - Custom dice: java DiceGame.java 3 (3 dice, 10000 simulations)
  - Custom both: java DiceGame.java 3 5000 (3 dice, 5000 simulations)

  Changes made:
  - Removed static final constants
  - Added constructor parameters for numDice and numSimulations
  - Updated main() to parse command line arguments
  - All references now use instance variables instead of constants

  promt 3: Can the code be improved with better performance?

  Yes, the code has been significantly optimized for better performance:

    Key optimizations:
    1. Array instead of ArrayList - Eliminates object creation/resizing overhead
    2. Single-pass dice processing - Finds threes and minimum in one loop instead of separate contains() and min() calls
    3. Primitive array for score tracking - Replaced HashMap with int array for O(1) access
    4. Eliminated boxing/unboxing - No Integer wrapper objects
    5. Removed Collection operations - No more removeAll(), Collections.min(), sorting

    Performance improvements:
    - Reduced memory allocations per game from ~10+ objects to 1 array
    - Eliminated autoboxing overhead
    - O(1) score frequency updates vs O(log n) HashMap operations
    - Direct array access vs collection iteration

    Test the optimized version:
    java DiceGame.java 5 100000

    The performance should be noticeably faster, especially with larger simulation counts.

    Before change:
    Total simulation took 50 milliseconds.

    After change:
    Total simulation took 5 milliseconds.
