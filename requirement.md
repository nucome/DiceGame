Using java 17 to create a class to play that is played with 5 dice. The objective of the game is to
obtain the lowest possible score. To that end, the rules of the game are as
follows: - All dice are thrown on a board.
- If there are any 3’s, all the 3’s are taken off the board and a score of 0 is awarded for this roll.
- If there are not any 3’s, the lowest die is taken off the board and the value of that lowest die is awarded for this roll.
- The remaining dice are now re-thrown and the same procedure as above is
followed until there are no dice left on the board.
- The total score for the game is the sum of all the rolls. also  simulate this game over 10000 iterations and keep a count of all the possible game scores.
The output should look something like below. 
Number of simulations was 100 using 2 dice. 
Total 0 occurs 0.1 occurred 10.0 times. 
Total 1 occurs 0.05 occurred 5.0 times. 
Total 2 occurs 0.14 occurred 14.0 times. 
Total 3 occurs 0.05 occurred 5.0 times. 
Total 4 occurs 0.07 occurred 7.0 times. 
Total 5 occurs 0.13 occurred 13.0 times. 
Total 6 occurs 0.15 occurred 15.0 times. 
Total 7 occurs 0.1 occurred 10.0 times. 
Total 8 occurs 0.1 occurred 10.0 times. 
Total 9 occurs 0.02 occurred 2.0 times. 
Total 10 occurs 0.05 occurred 5.0 times. 
Total 11 occurs 0.03 occurred 3.0 times. 
Total 12 occurs 0.01 occurred 1.0 times. 
Total simulation took 0.1 seconds.
